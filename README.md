# API-Testing-Project-Simple-Books
### I have learned API Testing by sending requests, such as *GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE*, with Postman, using demo APIs like [Simple Books](https://simple-books-api.glitch.me) with [API Documentation](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md).
### In this link you can find the collection created in Postman: [collection](https://github.com/IoanaFlore/API-Testing-Project-Simple-Books/blob/main/Simple%20BookS%20API.postman_collection.json)
#### In image below we can see the requests collection created in Postman:
